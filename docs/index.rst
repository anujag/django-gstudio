===================================
Django-gstudio's documentation!
===================================

Welcome to the version |version| of the documentation.

You may also find the differents editions of the
`documentation online at readthedocs.org`_.

The current documentation text was from the doc base of
django-blog-zinnia.  We haven't written django-gstudio specific
documentation as yet.  We still keep the django-blog-zinnia
documentation since it may be useful before we write gstudio specific
documentation.
