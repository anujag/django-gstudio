Gstudio is committed to standard representation notations provided by
various standard bodies.  RDF being one of the most widely used
language, we provide methods to obtain RDF representation of all the
data, excluding private information of users and system specific data.
We use rdflib library.  Therefore any notation or RDF store options
provided by rdflib can be supported. 

More details will be updated as and when we enhance the details of
this feature.
