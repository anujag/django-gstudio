==================
gstudio: Gnowledge Studio
==================

A collaborative workspace for constructing and publishing semantic
knowledge networks and ontologies is being constructed. 

Features taking shape
========

As and when a feature is tested and working it will be listed below.

Nodes implemented:
================
* metaTypes
* objectTypes

Currently gnowledge studio provides support for Metatypes and
Objecttypes. Using metatypes you can define different kinds of
concepts, like "concept names", "action names", "scientific concept",
"phylem" etc. Objecttypes are any regular classes, which can be
defined as members of Metatypes. Both objecttypes and metatypes can
have parent, siblings and children to create hierarchical structures.
In our next release we will have objects as members of objecttypes.
While we shape this project, if you are interested in joining, visit
us at metastudio.org.

==================
* objects
* relationTypes
* attributeTypes
* relations
* attributes
